# Clustering_with_ANI
clustering any sequences using ANI (Average Nucleotid Identity)  
I have build this tool for my personal research use, to fill the gap that exists in clustering tools. Indeed, most of the available programs that make clustering of sequences do not work with large sequences such as chromosomes, are not fully customisable, or are really heavy and time consuming processes.

Based on an available ANI script (provide the Source) i made a script that allows customisable clustering of any kind of sequences, no limit regarding size and/or number of sequences.
This tool relies on blast, so you must have it installed on your computer.
